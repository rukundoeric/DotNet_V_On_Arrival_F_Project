You are helping me design system diagrams for my project titled "Visa On Arrival Management System".

Below is my project description:

Problem: Manual visa-on-arrival processing causes delays at airports.
Goal: Build a digital system to register, verify, and approve visas quickly.

Project Summary:

Planning: Identify the delays and inefficiencies in the current manual process.

Analysis: Collect requirements from immigration officers and travelers.

Key needs: online application, document upload, payment, and quick verification.

Design:

Secure web-based application.

Database stores traveler details, passport info, and visa status.

Interfaces: traveler portal and immigration officer portal.

Implementation:

Modules: application form, document verification, payment, approval dashboard.

Integrate with airport immigration systems.

Testing:

Test registration, form submission, payment, and approval workflows.

Simulate valid and invalid documents.

Deployment:

Launch at airports and embassies.

Train staff and provide user guides.

Maintenance:

Update visa rules and policies.

Fix bugs and ensure 24/7 support.

Now do the following:

🧩 TASKS

Generate a Use Case Diagram

Include actors: Traveler, Immigration Officer, System Administrator, and Payment Gateway.

Include major use cases such as: Apply for Visa, Upload Documents, Make Payment, Verify Application, Approve/Reject Visa, View Visa Status.

Output the diagram in draw.io XML format (so I can paste it directly into draw.io to render the diagram).

Generate a Class Diagram

Include main classes such as Traveler, VisaApplication, Document, Payment, Officer, and Admin.

Show attributes, relationships, and key methods.

Output in draw.io XML format as well.

Generate an Activity Diagram

Focus on the workflow for “Visa Application and Approval Process.”

Steps: User registration → Login → Fill form → Upload documents → Make payment → Verification → Approval/Rejection → Notification.

Output in draw.io XML format.

Generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Entities: Traveler, VisaApplication, Document, Payment, Officer, and VisaStatus.

Include relationships (e.g., One Traveler can have many VisaApplications).

Output in draw.io XML format.

Discuss Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Present a clear list/table of functional requirements (features the system must perform).

Present a clear list/table of non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability, reliability, etc.).
